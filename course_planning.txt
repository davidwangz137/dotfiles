Fall 2017:
CO 442 Graph Theory
CS 360 (F,W,S)
PMATH 753 Functional Analysis (<-- Get Stephen Mandt to write a recommendation for this, since statistics uses measure theory and this makes sure that I have the background)
<-- also can talk about how I have read Stein 3rd
Some BS CS courses

CS 444 <- On board the compiler rape train.
ONE MORE CS400s in order to get CS major!!!!!!!
-> Ask for graduate course?
-> CS765 or CS764 would be nice
-> Can I do a topics course !?!?! -> CS860
-> CS779 requires a project and implementing something with openGL. Kind of torn

//Probably going to do something else instead of the below: they are too boring
//two of CS 485 or CS 444 or CS 489 <- see if there are any good topics for CS 489. Can also replace with graduate courses if they are applicable. Check who is teaching CS 485 to see if it is worth taking. Shai-ben David = PAC learning fun.

Humanities elective
PHYS233 (lol)

Coop: CO Research?

Coop: Try to take CO442 on coop. It is pretty worth. Do research then? 

Winter 2019:

CS 452 -> DEATH
CO 444 -> prereq PMATH 347 (just take it somewhere two terms before)
CO 452 
Humanities elective
Econ/Psych elective
PMATH 467 - Algebraic Topology

PMATH:

CO Courses:

CO 759: Topics in Discrete Optimization if others don't fit your liking
Previous offerings were algorithmic game theory
Computational Discrete Optimization (Cook!)

CO 342 (Graph Theory, F)
CO 450 (Combinatorial Optimization, F)

CO 446 (Matroid Theory, S) -> requires CO 342
CO 471 (Semidefinite Optimization, S). Literally matrices the course

CO 463 (Convex Optimization, W/F switching).

CO 444 (Algebraic Graph Theory, Every 2 years W, 2017, 2019)
CO 452 (Integer programming, Every 2 years W, 2017, 2019)

Maybe try grad CO/CS courses if you find some of these courses as shit. Have to pick these two terms before the term you take the course (add drop won't help as the grad courses only enroll 10/20 and will be full).

CS electives:

CS 365 (Models of Computation: W) / CS 360 (Intro to Theory of Computing: F,W,S) -> Easier

CS 462 (Formal Languages and Parsing. W) -> Check availibility
CS 452 (REAL TIME DEATH RAPE ALERT. W,S)
CS 487 (Symbolic: W)
CS 489 (Advanced topics: W) See if there are any good topics
CS 466 (Alg Design and Analysis: F,S)
CS 485 (Machine Learning: F,W. Confirm when you get to it)

6 needed

ENG/Humanities: 1 credit. If take prereq chain of 3 then get 1.5 credits -> perfect.

CLAS 202 (Ancient Roman society). Also CLAS 201 is similar (Ancient Greek society)

Psych/social sciences: 0.5 credits

ECON101 and ECON102 depending on the prof -> Larry Smith very hard.

PSYCH211 (Development Psychology) might be interesting and its easy.

PSYCH207 (Cognitive Processes) is all memorization but it is easy.

Three additional CS courses chosen from CS 340-398, 440-489.

Two additional CS courses chosen from CS 440-489.

One additional course chosen from

CO 487 Applied Cryptography 
CS 440-498 
CS 499T Honours Thesis 
STAT 440 Computational Inference 
CS 600- or 700-level courses

The selection of upper-year CS courses must include at least one course from each of at least two of the following area groups:

Systems and SE: CS 343, CS 349, CS 442, CS 444, CS 445, CS 446, CS 447, CS 450, CS 452, CS 454, CS 456, CS 457, CS 458
Applications: CS 348, CS 448, CS 449, CS 473, CS 476, CS 482, CS 484, CS 485, CS 486, CS 488
Mathematical Foundations of CS: CS 360, CS 365, CS 370, CS 371, CS 462, CS 466, CS 467, CS 475, CS 487


The 5.0 non-math units must satisfy the following elective breadth and depth requirements. (Alternate plans must be approved by a CS advisor.)

Elective breadth requirements

1.0 unit from the humanities (subjects from ARTS, CHINA, CLAS, CMW, CROAT, DAC, DRAMA, DUTCH, EASIA, ENGL, FINE, FR, GER, GRK, HIST, HUMSC, ITAL, ITALST, JAPAN, JS, KOREA, LAT, MUSIC, PHIL, POLSH, PORT, REES, RS, RUSS, SI, SPAN, SPCOM)

0.5 units from the pure sciences (subjects from BIOL, CHEM, EARTH, PHYS, SCI)
0.5 units from the pure and applied sciences (subjects from pure sciences plus ARCH, ENVS, ERS, GERON, HLTH, KIN, PLAN)
Note: No course can be used to satisfy more than one of the above requirements.
Elective depth requirements

1.5 units with the same subject, including at least 0.5 units at third-year level or higher

or
